WHERE filters individual records, HAVING filters grouped records

No podemos filtrar registros con un WHERE, para filtrar basados en una agregate function se usa HAVING:
SELECT release_year, COUNT(title) AS title_count
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;


Este es el orden de varias cosas que hemos visto:
SELECT certification, COUNT(title) AS title_count
FROM films
WHERE certification IN ('G', 'PG', 'PG-13')
GROUP BY certification
HAVING COUNT(title) > 500
ORDER BY title_count DESC
LIMIT 3;


In what years was the average duration over 2h?:
SELECT release_year, AVG(duration)
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING AVG(duration) > 120;
